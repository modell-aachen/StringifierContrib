%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This extension has been extracted from Foswiki:Extensions/KinoSearchContrib to make it available
for search engines other than kinosearch.

%TOC%

---++ Supported file formats

   * =.txt=
   * =.html=
   * =.xml=
   * =.doc=
   * =.docx=
   * =.xls=
   * =.xlsx=
   * =.ppt=
   * =.pptx=
   * =.pdf=
   * =.odt=
   * =.ott=
   * =.odp=
   * =.otp=
   * =.ods=
   * =.ots=
   * =.sxw=
   * =.stw=
   * =.sxc=
   * =.stc=
   * =.sxi=
   * =.sti=

If you add other file extensions, they are treated as ASCII files. If needed,
you can add more specialised stringifiers for further document types (see below).

---++ Backend for Indexing Word 2003 Documents

To index Word 2003 Documents (=.doc=) you will need to install one of the following:

   * =antiword= (recommended)
   * =abiword=
   * =wvWare=

You can then select the tool to use in =configure=.

---++ Backend for PDF

To index =.pdf= files you need to install =xpdf-utils=.

---++ Backend for PPT

To index =.ppt= files you need to install =ppthtml=.

---++ Backends for DOCX, PPTX, XLSX

To index these file types, you will need to install the following tools from Sourceforge:
   * [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt/][docx2txt]] for =.docx=
   * [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pptx2txt/][pptx2txt]] for =.pptx=
   * CPAN:Spreadsheet::XLSX for =.xlsx=

Then set the command path to these tools in =configure=.

---++ Backend for <nop>OpenDocument and Staroffice documents

To index these file types you need to install [[http://stosberg.net/odt2txt/][odt2txt]].

---++ Installing the Contrib

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Configuration

There are a number of settings that need to be set in =configure= before you can use the Contrib.

---++ Test of the Installation

   * Test if the installation was successful:
      * Check that =antiword=, =abiword= or =wvHtml= is in place: Type =antiword=, =abiword= or =wvHtml= on the prompt and check that the command exists.
      * Check that =pdftotext= is in place: Type =pdftotext= on the prompt and check that the command exists.
      * Check that =ppthtml= is in place: Type =ppthtml= on the prompt and check that the command exists.
      * =stringify= some files (see below)

---++ Test of Stringification with =stringify=

Some users report problems with the stringification: The stringifier scipts
fails, takes too long on attachments. Some times this may result from
installation errors, especially of the installation of the backends for the
stringification.

=stringify= give you the opportunity to test the stringification in advance.

Usage: =stringify file_name=

In the result you see, which stringifier is used and the result of the
stringification.

Example:

<verbatim>
stringify /path/to/foswiki/StringifierContrib/test/unit/StringifierContrib/attachement_examples/Simple_example.doc

Simple example  

Keyword: dummy  

Umlaute: Grober, Uberschall, Anderung
</verbatim>

---++ Further Development

In this extension, a plug-in mechanism is implemented, so that additional
stringifiers can be added without changing the existing code. All stringifier
plugins are stored in the directory =lib/Foswiki/Contrib/Stringifier/Plugins=. 

You can add new stringifier plugins by just adding new files here. The minimum
things to be implemented are:

   * The plugin must inherit from =Foswiki::Contrib::StringififierContrib::Base=
   * The plugin must register itself by =__PACKAGE__->register_handler($application, $file_extension)=;
   * The plugin must implement the method =$text = stringForFile ($filename)=

All the stringifiers have unit tests associated with them, and we would
encourage you to provide unit tests for any you wish to contribute. See
Foswiki:Development/UnitTests for more information on unit testing.

See Foswiki:Tasks/StringifierContrib for currently open tasks.
